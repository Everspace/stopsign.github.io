I'm creating a game where you play as a Local Friendly Hero, a talkative girl Fern who loves to gossip and spread news. and you have "focus" that you spend between 5 different shops at a time. Story wise, you have a spell to cast a point of listening for 1 focus, that lets you hear all the secrets, mundane and big, that fuel all your gossip. Eventually in the game, you will hear everything and be able to maximally tie people together with friendship and magic (in a way that makes for good game upgrades as well).

Besides listening, you can also spend focus on directly helping out one of the stores at a time. . The task is essentially dumping your remaining non-listening focus onto it. The more focus, the more it progresses, and the more that some extra features for the focus unlock.

The 6 shops are Bakery, Comic Store, Dance Studio, Bookstore, Coffee Shop, and Pet Shop. They each have NPCs that help each other out via upgrades that happen over time - but aided along with your focus. They each have NPCs that help each other out via upgrades that happen over time - but aided along with your focus. These are their names and personalities:

You (the player) is the hero, Fern, an girl with the following personality traits: Excitable, empathetic, optimistic, chatterbox, resourceful. Fern's hobbies are gossiping, socializing, community organizing, crafting friendship bracelets, and magic tricks. Fern's description is "A bundle of energy with a constant twinkle in her eyes, which are as bright as her infectious smile. Her appearance is casual yet spirited, often seen in colorful attire that matches her bubbly personality." Fern previously failed to mediate a major community conflict. She yearns to be the "Friendship Guru", and for the day when everyone can look past their differences. Struggles with the concept of privacy. 

Aspects of the game:
* In the game, Fern is the connecting piece between the shops. 
* The gameplay is entirely you deciding which shop Fern sits and gossips at - the shops themselves are automatically run by the NPCs behind them. So you have one button per shop, and that's to place Fern there. No other manual gameplay will be accepted at this stage of the game.
* Each shop is a different complex mix of idle mechanics that steadily grow in alternating periods of rapid growth and slow growth.
* Fern will provide three major functions while at a shop: 
	1. have a bonus somehow to the shop for being there (like 10 more items per second sold, if it somehow scales and is balanced) 
	2. Generate new "gossip" - AKA unlock an upgrade - based on milestones of the various shops, and the gossip is set up as being added to the queue of the OTHER shops - NOT the one Fern is currently at 
	3. Run out the gossip (that was unlocked by being at other shops) on the current shop that Fern is at. The types of gossip/upgrades will alternate between things that take lots of time and things that take short amounts that go first

Everyone gets to town at the same time, and so are new and setting up their shops. Write out the first month of drama, explaining what happens week by week to each character as they go about their lives and interact with each other.
