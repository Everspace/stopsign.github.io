Bake shop cycle:
	Prep work -> bake -> display -> sell
	Weekly activities
		Deep Cleaning
		Inventory Ordering
		Social Media Updates
			Advertising
			Responding to customer reviews
		Self-care
		
		
Game is divided into "Episodes"/stages, each one requiring various social and physical requirements to move on
Bonuses build up during the episode to happen in the next - mechanic to get bonuses w/o finishing episode, if needed.
Shops do things without respect to time
Each shop has different tasks that have to be done every week


Week 1 is 2 shops and basic interactions
Week 2 is 3 shops and more interactions, etc.


Goods produce per second
Each good has a shelf life.
Baker bakes new ones constantly, but if the goods expire without being sold, she instead focuses on social media engagement and customer engagement to make more customers.
Sales = Regular Customers * 10 + Reknown


Baker's cycle is essentially learn a new recipe/find suppliers for it/create it/generate clients for it
Only creates her latest learned recipe at a time
Only does advertising for her latest recipe
Loses 75% of regular customers every time she switches recipes
New recipe gives 1.2x the $, cost 1.15x more in ingredients
Fern counts for 10 regular customers, so Fern helps out in a huge way every time there's a new recipe
	While placed there, Fern increases regular customers to the bake shop, increasing the rate at which it grows
REQ: Customer rate grows quadratically ish, not exponential

1. Finding inspiration
INFO Baker starts looking at new recipe when she has 20+5*N non-fern customers (she gets bored)
PBAR, INFO Search for inspiration for next recipe, improves with Town Vibe (requires exponentially more time). Uses 50% of $. 50% of the money spent gets evenly split among other shops.

2. Prep Work - Once a recipe is found, Baker has to learn it and organize suppliers for it.
INFO Sqrt of remaining money gets added to ingredient quality, which sqrt of that improves good's value
INFO Supplier Connections starts at 1, increases with various upgrades or things Fern does. Stays pretty static mostly, never growing with time, only upgrades.
INFO Each recipe has an estimated supplier connection point, that increases by 1 per recipe. For each point you don't have, it's +3x longer to prepare the good. For each point you have above the recipe, it's +1 ethics for being able to avoid the worst supplier, and you get integrity/s based on ethics.
		Target Connection for <recipe>: 
		Penalty: Takes +3x longer per point difference
		Benefit: +1 ethics for the duration of the recipe

3. Producing and Selling - Baker creates her recipe
PBAR Takes 10+5*N seconds to create the good
Picture of each item on the shelves, pbar on each for expiration. Expires in 60+20*N seconds
PBAR It takes 20+10*N seconds per customer to sell a good
Info on # regular customers, and # random customers
Info on the baking good, including value, make time

4. Social Media
INFO Customers steadily create positive and negative reviews online. 
PBAR, INFO When no one buys the recipe, baker actively searches for customers, posting on social media:
	1. Respond to negative reviews (takes time, big customer improvements)
	2. Respond to positive reviews (takes time, medium customer improvements)
	3. Blog (time sink, small customer improvements)



Fern Actions
Basic: Eat baked goods - Happily munch away at whatever latest creation Emily has come up with! Counts as 10 regular customers. Does not count towards Emily's boredom.
N1 Focus: Fern chats with everyone who comes in, recommending the baked goods. +.01 regular customers/s
N2 Focus: Fern is talking all the time about others, and sometimes those relationships are useful. Connections +1 while Fern is there.

missed connections - thresholds & timers or lockouts, that decide different runs



simple increase mechanics
minerals in zerg wars - increase per second, increase rate
progress in progress knight quest - exponential upgrade that is the threshold for other upgrades
Repeated upgrade increases gain by x1000, have repeated upgrades at x1, x2, x10, x50, x250 - Coming back you can insta-gain up to where you should be, but waiting is still beneficial every time
exponential growth, but through lots of upgrades, so that you're constantly spending instead of letting it grow
compounding bonus | small amounts in different areas | upgrades at the end of a resource to make it useful for a long time still
progression of upgrades: manual, automatic, free
one resource that climbs exponentially, one that climbs slowly, require both - have meta upgrades for the slow upgrade
linear + log for resource/s and static cost upgrades
staggered upgrades with static cost and 0/X available
reset for a resource that grows/costs exponential, and after a bit, unlock another resource that does the same thing
a tree of upgrades, with each finishing to create two more
one resource pushes the maximum, another pushes the rate, both produce a third, which produces amount
20% gain, 25% cost, but 3 resources chained together in the pattern
compression, so selling 1 per second (or linear increase) while making the reward increase
lots of little upgrades, one that upgrades everything
one upgrade that takes a minute to fully engage



improvement mechanics
Prestige starts a new currency which can buy upgrades, including automation of the previous sections
Targets to hit among all currencies, so that if you get massive upgrades to one you reach a target sooner
not exactly prestige, but reach a point, reset, and unlock new things
	new things can reset previous prestiges
	have a slow down, such that you need x100 to get further, and it takes a while to get there
		makes it so with future upgrades, maybe the annoying ones can be skipped

Emily's bakery:
Preparing and baking happens when there's no customers
In general, the path is 
Cycle:
	Baking:	
		Preparing goods: 10s
		
Bakery:
Cycle:
	Ordering goods:
		1. Use $$/money to get suppliers
			a. $100 for new supplier, start with $140
			b. $100 for each new supplier, for total of 10. Buy when money available
			c. Each new supplier increases max # of ingredients available to buy
		2. Use $$ to increase storage, in freezer, to hold more at a time
		2. Suppliers bring ingredients - ~2-4 ingredients per baked good
			a. Each ingredient has an order time, a refill time, and a price
			b. Ingredients are:
				1. Cornmeal
				2. Flour
				3. Eggs
				4. Sugar
				5. Baking powder
				6. Chocolate
				7. Butter
				8. Bananas
				9. Cinammon
				10. Yeast
				11. Cream Cheese
		3. automatically spends $$ on ordering ingredients if there's no ingredients for the next item.
		4. Ingredients deliver after a time
		potential Fern upgrades:
			improve supplier prices
	Choosing a recipe/Baking:
		1. Choose the next available recipe to make. mixing|cooking|finishing
			* See excel sheet
		2. Make a batch, using all the available ingredients 
		
		
		Each Ingredient has:
		| * price
		| * Maximum - Can be increased 9 times at the ingredient price, up to 10
		| * buy supplier up to max buySupplier
		* Supplier Familiarity (Stranger|1, Contact|3, Acquaintance|10, New Customer|30, Regular|100, Returning Customer|300, Regular|1000, Recognized Shopper|3000, Valued Customer|10000, Frequent Buyer|30000, Preferred Customer|100000, Trusted Client|300000, Consultant, Advisor, Business Ally, Partner, Collaborator, Insider, Business Family, Confidant)
			** Starts at 10, and is ~x3 from there
			** Each level increases refill speed by 2x and maximum by 1.1x compounding
			** Familiarity increases by 1 per purchase
		* Difficulty - for unlocking groups at a time
		
		Each recipe has:
		| * Name
		* Difficulty
		* List of ingredients - type and num
		* Total price (ingredients added up)
		* Expertise (Untrained||10, Trained|100, Expert|1000, Master|10000)
			** Each increase increases the maximum batch size by 2
			** Each increase increases mixing and finishing time by 5% compounding
			** Each increase increases profit by 10% (x1.1 -> x1.14)
		| * Mixing/Cooking/Finishing ratio
		| * Name of cooking tool "oven"
		| * Time to complete in seconds
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		you get $ with the recipes, 
		and that scales up over time to switch to the next recipes, 
		so it could be an initial of 1 item capacity, 
		and $ based on the recipe cost for increasing the item capacity up to 10. 
		Then, there's a reputation per upgrade, that will slowly increase its maximum. 1/10th of this is permanently saved upon Block Party
		Reputation increases through various means and upgrades, and logarithmically increases the capacity of item capacity as well as the refill rate. 
		
		
	Emily AI:
		
		Emily will attempt to make the latest learned recipe
			If there are enough ingredients for it, she starts the cooking process
				Each stage (mixing|cooking|finishing) takes a different amount of time, and the total time changes based on batch size, with more being more efficient in time needed:
					per unit = (Base Effort - Base Effort/2) * Batch Size^-.1 + base effort/2
			At each stage completion, check if there's a customer
			If there are not enough ingredients for it, she will attempt to spend money increasing the suppliers maximum, then switch to the next lowest recipe and repeat
		If there is a customer
			Customers
				Have an initial talking time, 0-10 seconds.
				Have a time per item that they buy 1-4+
				Have a set amount of items that they buy 1-6+
				Have a set time that they start, and time that they repeat the purchases (no random)
				Have favorite items that they buy 4x as much of if available
				Have an initial reputation requirement
				Otherwise buy the cheapest item available
			Emily will spend 0-10 seconds per customer saying hello, then 1-4 seconds per item they want, then the same hello time +2 to pay and say goodbye
		Over time, Emily's proficiency at creating the latest item will increase through both her familiarity and through bigger batches from the suppliers
		Emily uses money on suppliers and on increasing display case size, but puts 10% of profit into her Inspiration fund
		When the display case is full, Emily gets on social media
			On social media, if there are reviews, Emily responds to them, which increases the reputation of the bakery
			New customers come if the reputation exceeds a certain amount
			If there are none, she browses the internet for a new recipe
				She stops if there's a customer, or if the display case isn't full.
				Boredom gets added a little every time the recipe is made, and a lot when browsing the internet
			If browsing the internet and boredom is maxed, goes on break
				Lose the inspiration fund. Each other shop gets 1/10th of the money
				Takes time based on the new recipe
				Customers still come and buy half as many items, "online orders only"
			When Emily comes back, she wants to practice the new recipe, so gets the suppliers for it, and browses the internet slowly improving the recipe while waiting for the ingredients
			Loops between making the new recipe and studying online while waiting for suppliers
			If display case runs out, bakes one batch at a time, focusing on studying the new recipe until its finished, based on the recipe difficulty
			After 10 practice batches made, start selling it.

Fern meets Emily
{


Fade in, single shop, only the counter visible, the sky is gray, Fern walks in

1. Emily: "Good morning! What can I get my very first customer of the day?"

2. Fern: "Ugh, decisions..."

3. Emily: "Rough night?"

4. Fern: "Yea, a fun one, I think... Well. I need something to make me a person again."

5. Emily: "You're in luck! Eat any of my treats, and I guarantee you'll be a person! What would you like?"

6. Fern: "Just give me your cheapest item."

7. Emily: "Hah! I get that a lot! Come to think of it, it's every time actually... Here you go!"

Fern sits and has her default happy pose. 

1. Fern: "Delicious! How do you do it?"

2. Emily: "Let me show you!"

Emily takes Fern throughout the bakery, having things become visible as they appear.

3. Emily: "This is the kitchen! For each recipe, we have to prepare, cook, and finish, and its all done here."

4. Emily: "This is the freezer! I need to order the ingredients from my suppliers to make my recipes!"

5. Emily: "This is my office! Social media presence is important as well! I also might start looking for new recipes online soon."

6. Emily: "And of course my display! This is where I showcase my best."

Confusion symbols appear above Fern's eyes and head, and all 4 appear right after each other.

1. Emily: "Oh! Sorry, I just realized you probably meant for me to say something like 'lots of practice' instead of showing you around my shop. I get carried away sometimes!"

1. Fern: "No problem, I know the feeling! Thanks for showing me around!"

2. Emily: "It's nice to talk with someone while I work!"

3. Fern: "... Half off items if I stay and chat?"

4. Emily "... no discounts"

5. Fern: "... Full price items while I stay and chat?"

6. Emily: "That's better. Agreed!"

Fern meets Adrian





====
the challenges are the pre-stories of each character, that built up to the current moment

treat each shop like the idle loops zone, at least approximately in complexity


====

start of game should be ~~idle loops :
+1 attention/s
start focused on bakery
"Wander" to get to the bakery | req 20 attention
"meet Emily" to do the story above, results in sitting at Emily's buys 1 good per 10 seconds
"listen to supplier deals" unlocks next
"Expanding options" "you seem to like talking, you should visit the next store over, the coffee shop!"
"Meet Adrian"

====

future upgrades
Emily early riser, starts with X minutes of progress already done at the start of the day
===

when out of named upgrades, fern gets idle chatter +1/s on every shop but the one she's on.
each shop has unlocks based on idle chatter # from there on out


====


sometimes, with some big upgrades, you pick 3 cards from your "deck", which contain various upgardes or QoL or shortcuts
After you reset the day, when you go to the same spot, you have a 4th option - the card you used last time (if it's not in use already). You can get/use cards in your draw that are only found later in the run
	Later, you can get an upgrade to "lock" in certain cards to their spots, letting you no longer get those in the draw
This means that each reset, you'll be able to optimize (based on luck) your build a little more, pushing the higher power cards to the front of your run.

buy instantly
each ingredient has a resupply rate

redo emily's AI

-pyramid of unlocks, sometimes going backwards
-supplies are bought from the grocery store instantly, and it stocks up slowly, increasing in response to you buying it up to 10x but no more. Profit 5-3% linear scaling.
-After, emily starts making connections with suppliers. Profit 5-10%+ upgrade scaling


Basic Ingredients (flour, eggs, sugar)
	5 available
	Respawn .1/s
	Market response: Increase x1.01 respawn rate per item bought, up to a 10x total. Also +.1 storage up to 25
	
Simple Ingredients (butter, cornmeal, buttermilk, yeast, chocolate, bananas, cinnamon)
	5 available
	respawn .01/s
	Market response:Increase x1.01 respawn rate per item bought, up to a 10x total. Also +.1 storage, up to 25

	
	
First Recipe, Muffins: 1 Flour, 1 Eggs, 1 Sugar. Difficulty 2, 4 mixing/5 cooking/1 finishing
	Fern buys as much as she can. The store has 10 of each, so she buys 10 to fill her storage with a maximum capacity of 10. She will make as many muffins as she can. The difference in formula between making more:
	She makes 1 muffin
		mixing will take 2 * 4 * 1 = 8 seconds (difficulty * ratio * multiplier based on amount)
		cooking will take 2 * 5 * 1 = 10 seconds
		finishing will take 2 * 1 * 1 = 2 seconds
		total time: 20s/muffin
	She makes 10 muffins in a batch
		mixing will take 2 * 4 * (1 + .9 + .8 + .7 + ... (10 of them)) = 2 * 4 * 6.51 = 52.08
		cooking will take 2 * 5 * (1 + (.2 * N-1)) = 2 * 5 * 4.8 = 48s
		finishing will take 2 * 1 * (1 + .95 + .91 + ...) = 2 * 1 * 8.02 = 16s
		total time: 116, or 11.6/muffin

each character is sort of an expression of who I am
emily - perfectionist
adrian - outgoing
oliver - introspective
isabella - memory 
lucas - passionate

what am i trying to do:
reformat emily's goals to be more reset/progress pyramid type:

Each new recipe has a happiness requirement

emily's progress should be slowly climbing up an "achievement" board of some kind, that unlocks new things and bonuses at each stage


TODO next:
choose pictures
position them
turn them on or off depending on position
change position logic to work with multiple times 
add a progress bar and show it depending on position
start AI logic 
	Connect ingredients
	setup unlock systems
	new resources, one for primary progress, one for global happiness
	


"i live here, this is my house too. You can't force me"
	- "you can't make me" childish. An unacceptable response for literally anything. "Take out the trash. You can't make me." Unacceptable because it is childish, and because I deserve an adult answer.
	- not the point. the point is for you to go to bed first.
		1. you take a long time doing teeth and stuff. I don't want to sit there for that
		2. I want to go upstairs and put my phone down and sleep. I cannot if I'm sitting there waiting for that.
		3. I want time to decompress. This time must be alone. I need to turn off the part of me that is constantly thinking of others
		4. I don't like long conversations that shift bed times. I need consistency
		5. You have stated that you want to go to bed early. Me asking you should be in line with your stated goals, right?
	- being loud = day time. night time is when quiet begins. No quiet/dark = no night time = stay up. I use social queues instead of physical ones because my physical ones lie to me.
