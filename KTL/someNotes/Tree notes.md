TODO:
find a target action and build backwards for a while. 
You don't have to connect yet, but write the finish at least 


  
Gain Access to Academy - different ways that have their own feedback loops.  
All actions in the middle have max levels.  
Lowest trail levels have lower max efficiency % if counting max level and straight to academy  
- unlock and send Resolve to higher access trails to get more and more resolve to actually reach Academy  
The different ways are unlocked by various stat levels, which also serve as goals for the player to push to next


ways to access the academy

Path of trials:
-pathfinding, dexterity, and mapfinding

path of betrayal:
-combat stats

Path of talent:
-intelligence stats / shortcuts / puzzle solving 

Path of Resourcefulness:
-Make friends with a rich guy and use his easy transport 


map out jobs and what skills/stats upgrade them (money, action unlocks, boosts)
map out city adventures and what they unlock (social stuff, boosts)
map out academy (to unlock endgame spots)
map out adventures (pyramid, dripping cave, monster hunt, abyssal defense) for endgame bonuses



In general, gameplay is 
1. leveling up/unlocking the different labor jobs, which gets you access to the city
2. get recognition to unlock new city jobs
3. unlocking/leveling up city jobs, then choose a specialty
	1. combat
	2. money -> magic
	3. crafting
4. Go further in your specialty and clear a challenge there
5. Join the army, assist as soldier/mage/medic/crafter
6. (action: button click, req total momentum above a certain num, and other reqs) - "use all momentum to try to kill the lich". Starts minigame with new actions / lump sum of all momentum. It's barely enough to go find a necklace, and then kill the lich's first champion
7. Reset, gain 3x exp up to previous level, everything else is cleared. Prestige currency reduces tier of select actions. Select a card for specializing in combat/money/magic/crafting, and each unlocks more actions which give you a much higher total momentum at the end

Problem: not enough reason to come to the game except unlocking new actions 
problem: choices are just a 50% or 100%, not real investments
solution: 
	-have ways to improve actions, force people to specialize
		-not great - what actions would be buffed and how? (temp reduction of tier?)
	-have much larger reasons to divert resources one way or another 
		-temporary bonuses
		-important unlocks
	-game should largely rotate which section gets all the sweet bonuses
		-with proper game balance, if you let one "branch" coming off of Overclock be dead at a time, then resources sent to it are rather wasted, and it makes switching in a focused manor more desirable - making movespeed better. Solve this with balance, but make sure to include this at all times - socialize
			-socialize for a bit to learn someone deeply, and then stop. Can do this early. Actions have max levels.
			-remember is the more-or-less-constant, but it frequently is hanging while you unlock higher levels for it. Later it becomes a key to push hard as it greatly improves Overclock in a feedback loop. Has max levels on the early nodes, none on the later ones
			-makeMoney/spendmoney every now and then gets improved enough to be charged first as a big leap forward
			-travelToOutpost is where action have max levels and quickly get to 100% efficiency, making them not spend any as they travel. This will split into multiple actions that do start not having max levels, but the "road" is clear (or can be upgraded to that point), so to speak
			--jobs:  is a pretty steady yet needed big drain, with big jumps in money gaining per level. jobs can cover ranges where they're effective, which is essentially a rough estimate for when the stats are supposed to be the most effective for them.
