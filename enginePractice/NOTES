bring action list to phone




reshape the actions
the unveling of the resources should be more *grand*
first few actions have max level and give huge buffs
overall, give stats at 50 and 100 at a time, aiming for thousands


everyone gets a talent, and yours is "with sufficient resolve, there are no barriers" and eventually you realize you want more motivation


you're prepared for a future that's not happening, because the world started ending - monsters are appearing in portals all over the country
your parents died a couple of years ago and you've been in a funk since. You have money and education, but minimal connections.
You've been desperate for purpose, and you've decided fighting monsters is your calling.
You also just read a book where the character helped himself by helping others.
The country is collapsing, but your lands are self-sufficient and unaffected... for now.

--This is the spine of the story, but it means a lot can change.
For example, the world can be medieval, steam punk, or modern. The monsters can be demons, an invasion, aliens, etc.

...

It wasn't enough. You were missing something crucial: being wrong. Having counselors and professionals to tell you how to *think*, not just what they can offer.

You have time now, though, thanks to your parent's artifact.

======

stop being mired to motivate / spend money / socialization / mana
it can be a different starting point, or a different alternate

1st attempt: on your own, with your own knowledge - money, self-improvement
2nd attempt: gaining knowledge (+mana) to go on
3rd attempt:


experiment with design patterns
anime|pixar etc.



actions, radial:
East - Advance in the story
West - Enhance the ability to advance
South - personal
North - social




actions need to be "carved" into memory, having a very very low rate of expertise to start, which affects their ability to use resolve
actions have 0-100% expertise, and start at an amount related to how much the character would know about them. Raising expertise is *hard*.
Expertise is efficiency - it will waste resolve and not consume it for progress or sending - only 100% expertise will be "no" waste

expertise doesn't get better by default when you reset - many completions will help the efficiency.
Personal will account for roughly ~30% of expertise gain (more in the beginning), and social 70% in the ideal (ramping up over time)
Expertise works by adding to a new var Object.skill. Expertise changes the efficency to =


Change to 1% motivate cimb, adding +.1 each reset up to 2%
Chagne starting resolve gain to 1
keep tier 0 for a bit, because efficiency is gonna be baad
req: 1st action improves motivate, 2nd action improves 1st, 3rd unlocks 4th which improves 2nd, etc. - grow fast and hard at the start


Visualize Victory
Remember the fallen <- Honor Past Sacrifices / Pay Tribute to Heroes <- Commemorate Heroes <- Light a Beacon (req: masterwork art?)
Reaffirm your vows <- Practice Devotion <- Worship <- Divine Communion


vice, which increases its own stat and decreases the other's stats
